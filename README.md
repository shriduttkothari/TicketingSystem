# Solution Aproach
Though in this probem it was given that there is only single path between first and last station, like a LinkedList.
But i solved the problem assuming it as a graph problem where there can be multiple paths between any two stations.

I have used BFS Graph Traversal approach to search the shortest pathbetween given two stations.

Improvementst can be done in the code, like code refactoring and cleanup etc. But as there was time constrain so i could not work on it.

# Time Complexity 
The time Complexity would be Big O(S*E), where S is the number of stations in the system and E is the distance between the stations.
